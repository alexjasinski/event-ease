# EventEase C# Blazor app with form validation, state management, and attendance tracking

## Copilot Assistance in EventEase App Development

1.  **Foundational Components (Activity 1)**
    
    -   _Assistance_: Copilot generated initial Razor components (`EventList`, `EventDetails`, `Registration`) and boilerplate Blazor code (routing, layouts, navigation).
        
    -   _Benefit_: Accelerated setup of the project structure and ensured consistent component patterns.
        
2.  **Debugging and Optimization (Activity 2)**
    
    -   _Assistance_: Suggested fixes for binding issues in Razor pages, optimized loops in `EventList`, and recommended proper use of `@inject` for services.
        
    -   _Benefit_: Improved reliability and performance by catching common Blazor mistakes early.
        
3.  **Advanced Features (Activity 3)**
    
    -   _Registration Form with Validation_: Copilot generated form markup with `EditForm`, `DataAnnotationsValidator`, and model validation attributes (e.g., `[Required]`, `[EmailAddress]`).
        
    -   _State Management_: Suggested using `Scoped` services and `ProtectedSessionStorage` to persist user session data.
        
    -   _Attendance Tracker_: Helped scaffold methods for adding/removing participants in `Event.cs` and tracking attendance per session.
        
    -   _Benefit_: Reduced manual coding effort for complex Blazor patterns, ensuring correctness and adherence to best practices.
        
4.  **Testing & Error Handling**
    
    -   _Assistance_: Proposed unit test structures for validating form submissions and verifying state continuity.
        
    -   _Benefit_: Simplified testing by providing templates for checking both success and error scenarios.
        
5.  **Production Readiness**
    
    -   _Assistance_: Suggested code cleanup steps (removing unused dependencies), improving component reusability, and enforcing Blazor best practices (like using `OnInitializedAsync`).
        
    -   _Benefit_: Made the codebase more maintainable and deployment-ready.

✅ **Result**: With Copilot’s assistance, the EventEase app became a **fully functional, tested, and deployable Blazor application** that integrates event listing, registration with validation, session tracking, and attendance monitoring.
